# Tech-Blog

Description

Built a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site completely from scratch and deployed to Heroku. This app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
